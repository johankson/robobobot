Work in progress...

A small checklist to follow:

- [ ] IMPORTANT: Check if there's an issue, or create one to discuss the feature before coding along.
- [ ] Rebase the PR with main.
- [ ] Write tests to covered the important parts. Study existing tests the get a hang of the style.
- [ ] Documentation in markdown, update what is relevant and add new files for what's brand new.

## Code style

Some ground rules when it comes to the styling of the code.

### PascalCasing

- File names, Directory names (`Fixtures/Ducks.txt`)
- Type names, classes and enums and so on.

## Testing

We use xUnit for testing, NSubstitute and FluentAssertions.
