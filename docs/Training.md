# Training

Sending your troops into battle untrained is a bad idea. In the **sandbox mode** you can run your bot as many times as you'd like locally on your own machine.

## Prereqs - the server

You need to have access to a server to train your bot. But that's simple and free.

1. Clone the repo
2. Run the server (perhaps via [`docker`](Docker.md) or using `dotnet run`)
